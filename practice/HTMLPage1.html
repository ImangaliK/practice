      The day of love in Kazakhstan. April 15 - the day of great love of Kozy-Korpesh and Bayan-Sulu.
  </b>
    <p>
      April 15 in Kazakhstan is celebrated as a day of lovers Kozy-Korpesh and Bayan-Sulu. This holiday was<br>
      offered as an alternative of the holiday of St. Valentine's Day. Though the day of Kozy-Korpesh and<br>
      Bayan-Sulu didn’t get the official status, people celebrate this day actively. Every year the youth arrange<br>
      a number of events which are close to the Kazakh folk custom and traditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    An ancient legend about tragic love of Kozy-Korpesh and Bayan-Sulu has it that: friends since the childhood<br>
    Sarybay and Karabay swore to marry their children that were affianced even before the children’s birth.<br>
    But Sarybay died during hunting before the birth of the son. Growing-up Kozy and Bayan, connected by bonds<br>
    of the marriage contract, fell in love with each other.
</p>
<p>
  But as time passed perfidious Karabay changed plans. He promised to bestow his daughter in marriage for local<br>
  djigit Kodar who has rescued once Karabay’s flocks from jute. Kodar becomes a barrier between the lovers.<br>
  In this eternal love triangle the first who died was Kozy. Soul-sick Bayan resorted to cunning to revenge the murderer.<br>
  She promised to marry Kodar if he builds a well with spring water. Kodar started to work, holding hair of the girl.<br>
  But unexpectedly Bayan cut off plaits and Kodar fell in the well and perished. Bayan revenged Kozy’s death.<br>
  On his grave the heroine of the legend stabbed herself with a dagger. Many people who visited the burial<br>
  of the Kazakh lovers heroes, say that it overgrew a marvelous bush of dogrose on which once scarlet and white roses blossomed.
